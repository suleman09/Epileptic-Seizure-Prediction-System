## Welcome to the Epileptic Seizure Prediction System GitHub repository!

This repository is dedicated to the development of an AI-based system that aims to predict epileptic seizures in patients. Epileptic seizures can have a severe impact on the quality of life of patients and their families, and our goal is to provide a reliable tool for predicting seizures in advance so that patients can take necessary precautions.

The system uses a machine learning algorithm trained on EEG signals collected from patients. We believe that this system can help healthcare professionals to monitor their patients more closely and provide better care.
